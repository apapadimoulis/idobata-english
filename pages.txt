WHY?
WHY IDOBATA
We made Idobata to solve developer's worries about team development.

It's painful to maintain server for IRC...

I wish I could @username style mention with type-ahead...

I want easy and adequate integration with GitHub, CI and so on...

How to see transversely all messages which I am interested in?

Developer's chat should be more programmable...

ORGANIZATION
ONE ACCOUNT, MULTIPLE TEAMS
In Idobata, you can belong to multiple organizations such as enterprises and communities. In Organization, you can create multiple rooms as many as you want.

You can invite an outside person as a guest to a room. A guest can only join the rooms which allow access from the guest.

From the Timeline view, you can cross view each room across each organization.


INTEGRATION
SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN 20 DEVELOPER TOOLS
With Idobata's Webhook, you can easily set up notifications for development tools.

For GitHub, which is widely used in particular, Idobata provides well-desined notification messages.

Furthermore, you can customize the hooks which you use by contributing to idobata-hooks or creating Custom Webhooks for your own use.


BOT
CREATE A BOT AND CUSTOMIZE THE ROOM FREELY
You can do anything by creating a bot. Idobata supports Hubot.

Let's tell your bot "Tally up the count", "Translate it" or, ask "How is the weather?". In cooperation with home appliances, you can tell the bot "Turn on the heater".
